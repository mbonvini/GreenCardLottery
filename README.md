# GreenCardLottery

The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program (DV Program) makes up to 50,000 immigrant visas available 
annually, drawn from random selection among all entries to individuals who are from countries 
with low rates of immigration to the United States. 
The DV Program is administered by the U.S. Department of State (DOS).

Every year about 10 millions of people take part in the DV lottery, and approximately
only 150 thousand of them are selected. The selected candidates receive a number (between
1 and 150000). This number determines when and if they'll be able to get their green card.
How does it work? Every month the DOS releases the so called visa bulletin.
The bulletin states which of the numbers will be processed in a specific month.

For example Alice applies in the DV lottery for fiscal year 2015.
She is lucky enough to be selected and her number is 13000. The DOS starts interviewing candidates
for the DV lottery 205 in October 2014. DOS releases the visa bulletin for the month of 
October 2014 and it says that DOS will process candidates with numbers from 1 to 8000. 
In this case Alice has to wait for the visa bulletin of November and hope that in that month 
DOS will be able to process his number. If DOS will never call her number by the time September
2015 arrives, Alice loses her possibility to get a green card.

Candidates like Alice typically have no clues when their numbers will be processed, or if they'll be
processed at all (remember that DOS selects 150000 candidates and there are only 55000
green cards available).

The script in this repository allows to gather information about the visa bulletin from
fiscal year 2003 until 2015. With such information one can compute some statistics
and understand or predict when she/he should be ready for the interview and get 
her/his green card.
